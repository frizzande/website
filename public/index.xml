      <description>&lt;p&gt;writing training programs is the best.&#xA;the unique puzzle of aligning values, goals, schedules, equipment, time constraints.&#xA;and it&amp;rsquo;s way more fun doing it for someone else than for ourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;started up a saturday morning run club at the gym.&#xA;meet at 06:00, a bit of &amp;ldquo;gentle exercise&amp;rdquo; around the streets of Botany.&#xA;last week (the first week) was us and Hook, went for a 5km in ~27:30.&#xA;this week was us, Dyls, Camillo, Hook and his kids.&#xA;appropriate, on the anniversay of Dennett&amp;rsquo;s passing, that we have created our own version of Runfit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;nationals is over now.&#xA;we&amp;rsquo;re taking a break from that level of competition, which brings with it a void, an emptiness.&#xA;what are we training for?&#xA;mostly, now, we train to train.&#xA;because it gives us energy, and outlet.&#xA;it gives us a way to understand ourself over time.&#xA;we&amp;rsquo;ve been jumping into classes at jbs, and training with the other coaches when they do their sessions.&#xA;lifting with Sam, mobility with Kyron, Rae&amp;rsquo;s bodyweight class on a tuesday night (handstand pushups currently - we can just about do an eccentric with the wall).&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s been wonderful, freeing ourself from the need to prepare or peak for a competition.&#xA;letting someone else worry about the programming, just showing up and showing out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;feedback is a gift.&#xA;an opportunity to gain perspective and consider ways to improve.&#xA;so long as our ego is in check.&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s easy to be defensive, to try to preserve our confidence and self-esteem by insisting that we&amp;rsquo;re doing a good job.&#xA;which, maybe?&#xA;but we could always be doing a better job.&#xA;and that is our mission.&#xA;to improve, to do better, to hone our craft as we progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we struggle with names.&#xA;there are ~150 members at the gym and for most of our time training at jbs we came in the afternoon or evening.&#xA;we were already roasting coffee when the morning classes were on.&#xA;so we&amp;rsquo;ve had to introduce ourself to members and try to remember their names and faces.&#xA;which can be difficult when we&amp;rsquo;re still getting familiar with the gym and the processes and movements and everything that comes with the transition to coaching.&#xA;unfortunately for us, embarassment is one of the best ways to learn - the emotional turmoil of publicly calling someone by the wrong name.&#xA;sorry Lewis!&#xA;and thank you for pulling us aside privately, rather than the public callout.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;restlessly awake, again, from ~03,00.&#xA;coach thoughts churning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we were concerned about getting feedback on our class coaching, particularly as the other coaches rarely train in the early timeslots.&#xA;Dylan shared with us that class attendance has remained steady since we&amp;rsquo;ve started coaching - and if people weren&amp;rsquo;t enjoying them, they&amp;rsquo;d stop coming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;there were 16 people in the 06,45 class today - and it was awesome!&#xA;we are grateful to be on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we woke repeatedly throughout the night with coaching thoughts racing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;what classes are we coaching?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;what are the main movements, cues, pops?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;will anyone come if it&amp;rsquo;s raining again?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;what games could we play to get people laughing and moving?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how can we develop our skills as a class coach?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;definitely a trial run of tip/tag for tomorrow morning, channel the inner child on the playground.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we prefer &amp;rsquo;they/them&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we prefer the third person plural as we believe that we are more than one person&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we are typing these letters into a computer keyboard&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and we are reading these words on our website&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the plurality of our singularity&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;this piece originated from a prompt: a birthday letter from us at 32 to our future present self - and yet, we found an obstruction, a blockage, as traditionally (previously) the birthday letter would be exchanged with one from MADDY, whom we have sadly not encountered for a hot minute. sunshine and turtles going out to you, homeslice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and so, what follows is a treatise on &lt;strong&gt;THE HAIR CRISIS&lt;/strong&gt;, and how it came to be &lt;strong&gt;THE HERE CRISES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People have asked me where I&amp;rsquo;ve been. They&amp;rsquo;ve noticed I&amp;rsquo;m not in any of the photos of Bench in Hawaii, and that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at Eastern Regionals two weekends ago. I&amp;rsquo;m okay, but i didn&amp;rsquo;t feel up to flying to Kaimana or driving to Canberra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;February was a month for me, and really it was a month after a couple of other months. I&amp;rsquo;m a big disc nerd; I love friz. The high of friends + running has always been a solid foundation when other things haven&amp;rsquo;t been going so well. I missed a couple of Brunches with the boys, which was disappointing, even if I think it was the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
