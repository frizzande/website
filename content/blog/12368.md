restlessly awake, again, from ~03,00.
coach thoughts churning.

we were concerned about getting feedback on our class coaching, particularly as the other coaches rarely train in the early timeslots.
Dylan shared with us that class attendance has remained steady since we've started coaching - and if people weren't enjoying them, they'd stop coming.

there were 16 people in the 06,45 class today - and it was awesome!
we are grateful to be on this journey.
