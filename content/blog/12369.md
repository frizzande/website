we struggle with names.
there are ~150 members at the gym and for most of our time training at jbs we came in the afternoon or evening.
we were already roasting coffee when the morning classes were on.
so we've had to introduce ourself to members and try to remember their names and faces.
which can be difficult when we're still getting familiar with the gym and the processes and movements and everything that comes with the transition to coaching.
unfortunately for us, embarassment is one of the best ways to learn - the emotional turmoil of publicly calling someone by the wrong name.
sorry Lewis!
and thank you for pulling us aside privately, rather than the public callout.
