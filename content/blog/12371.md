nationals is over now.
we're taking a break from that level of competition, which brings with it a void, an emptiness.
what are we training for?
mostly, now, we train to train.
because it gives us energy, and outlet.
it gives us a way to understand ourself over time.
we've been jumping into classes at jbs, and training with the other coaches when they do their sessions.
lifting with Sam, mobility with Kyron, Rae's bodyweight class on a tuesday night (handstand pushups currently - we can just about do an eccentric with the wall).
it's been wonderful, freeing ourself from the need to prepare or peak for a competition.
letting someone else worry about the programming, just showing up and showing out.
