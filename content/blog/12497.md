acquired an anytime fitness membership

a return to commercial gyms for the first time since training at Jungle Botany

reflecting on the difference between types of gyms, and what it is that makes JBs different

commercial gyms exist to make money - a subscription to access machines

not that we don't exist to make money

but rather, the focus is on community, connection - a shared sense of purpose

the weights in commercial gyms are nomadic

no fixed home or place to live

equally on the rack,

the floor,

or left on the last machine they were attached to
