started up a saturday morning run club at the gym.
meet at 06:00, a bit of "gentle exercise" around the streets of Botany.
last week (the first week) was us and Hook, went for a 5km in ~27:30.
this week was us, Dyls, Camillo, Hook and his kids.
appropriate, on the anniversay of Dennett's passing, that we have created our own version of Runfit.
