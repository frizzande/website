feedback is a gift.
an opportunity to gain perspective and consider ways to improve.
so long as our ego is in check.
it's easy to be defensive, to try to preserve our confidence and self-esteem by insisting that we're doing a good job.
which, maybe?
but we could always be doing a better job.
and that is our mission.
to improve, to do better, to hone our craft as we progress.
