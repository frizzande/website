Sunday last week, I got on the wrong train going to visit my old housemates, and I ended up in **Revesby**.  

On Monday last week, I got on the wrong train going to a weightlifting session with my coach, and I ended up in **Revesby**.  

And so, Tuesday last week, I decided to get on the train and go to **Revesby**, because I believe in training triples.  

If something happens, that's an experience.  
If it happens twice, that's repetition.  
But if it happens three times, that's training.

I've been pondering lately, what the simplest form of training is?
One of the things I tell people is that it's easy to do too much, and it's nearly impossible to do too little.  

Training, at its essence, boils down to doing a thing three times with intent.  

It's easy to make excuses and say:  

- "I don't have time."  
- "I'm tired."
- "It's too hard."

My simplest form of training is **intentionally breathing**.  

You can try this for yourself:  

Breathe in and out â€” that's zero.  

Then take three breaths, for as long as possible:  
- Breathe in and hold. As much air as you can hold. Keep holding. 
- Exhale as slowly as you can.  
- Do that two more times.  

I would consider that to be a training session.

You could do more, obviously, but I think at a real fundamental level, all forms of training boil down to **breathing intentionally**, with more or less movement from the rest of your body.
