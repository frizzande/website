# Warami

G'day, name's ande!
I was born on Dharug land in modern day Sydney, Australia - a beautiful country with a complicated legacy of colonisation where sovereignty was never ceded. 
Always was, always will be indigenous land.

## Purpose
I am a coach and personal trainer.
My mission is to empower people to express their physicality with joy and grace.

## Background
As a kid growing up, my parents encouraged me to play a wide range of sports to stay active and be a part of a team environment: soccer was my first real passion from the age of 5.
I dreamed of playing for Arsenal in the EPL, a combination of Dennis Bergkamp’s silky skills and Thierry Henry’s ruthless finishing.

Through high school I fell in love with distance running, thanks to the guidance of a very dear friend and teacher, the late Bruce Dennett, who ran weekly sessions before classes as well as a regular Saturday morning run for over 40 years.
To me, running is a unique part of being a human - the ability to roam and explore the world, powered by just my legs, lungs, and heart.

As a fresh university student, I struggled to adjust to the size and scope of the campus and my classes, which could have more than 1000 people in a lecture.
Here, I was fortunate to be introduced to the sport of Ultimate, a fast paced and action packed combination of AFL and NFL that is unique for being played with self-officiation: there are no external referees, and each player on the field is responsible for avoiding contact and upholding the Spirit of the Game.
This emphasis on individual and team responsibility for playing the right way fosters a wonderfully diverse and inclusive community, where games are hotly contested - but as friends rather than foes.

In 2013 I was selected to the Australian U24 Opens Ultimate Team (the Goannas) and was introduced to strength training for the first time.
Working with Miles Downie at Sydney Uni Sport and Fitness, I started training regularly in the weights room: building muscle, strength, speed, and power as I strived for selection on the senior Australian Ultimate team in 2016.

Life, however, presented other obstacles: I was diagnosed with a rare type of skin cancer that year, a tumor that grew out of the left side of my chest.
While I was extremely fortunate to catch it early and avoid radiation or chemotherapy, I underwent 3 surgeries to remove the growth and as a result had severely limited use of my left arm for the better part of a year.

After this, the priority and focus of my training shifted from competition to exploration: reconnecting with myself and my body after an intensely traumatic experience.
For me, training is an exploration of my capabilities and capacity for work, a joyous celebration of being alive and exploring what is possible.

## FAQs
**What makes your coaching style unique?**

I blend together a wide range of skills, experiences, and mentors. I have a keen interest in human learning, attention, and behaviour through my university studies, which is particularly helpful in developing robust habits around training. I endeavour to make training fun and engaging, and connecting to each individual’s values and purpose as a way to embrace the need for consistent work over time.


**What’s your “why” for training and coaching?**

Training has always been an outlet for me, a way to express myself and grow over time. I see training as being a crucial way to survive in the modern world, which has largely removed the environmental pressures on us to survive and accordingly live increasingly sedentary lives. My mission is to empower people to express their physicality with joy and grace.


**What do you wish more people understood about training?**

The process of training is more akin to worship than anything else. The real value is in the process of showing up regularly and consistently, and recognising that while not every session can be your best, they still build and accumulate together over time. Understanding why training is important to you is far more valuable than the particulars of any training program or style.


**What’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned from injury, failure, or setbacks?**

Injury is opportunity in disguise. Before my cancer treatment, I mostly trained what was fun to me as a runner (ie, squats and deadlifts) and very rarely considered my upper body. After the surgeries, I needed to relearn how to use my arms and so became more interested in training the upper body. Similarly, I got my first muscle up after spraining my ankle: I couldn’t squat or deadlift, so channeled my energy to what was available (while still doing the rehab!)


**What’s something you used to believe that you don’t anymore?**

That you need to destroy yourself for a session to be worthwhile. Yes, there is a particular satisfaction in pushing yourself to your limits, but there’s also a higher risk of injury in training this way - and it can be unsustainable over the long term.


**What’s your message to someone just starting out?**

Find a friend who trains, go with them and do whatever . Training is more fun with company and it’s the best way to learn about the process while also holding yourself accountable.


**What’s something you try to pass on to every client?**

That movement is a gift and a joy, rather than an obligation or a burden. Truthfully, the value of training is found outside the gym: it shines through in the moments of crisis, injury, or adversity when we are struggling to survive.


**What’s the one thing you want people to feel when they train with you?**

A greater sense of connection to their body, their self, and their capabilities.
